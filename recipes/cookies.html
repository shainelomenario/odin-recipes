    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <p> To make chewy chocolate chip cookies, follow these concise steps: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Melt Butter: </strong>Melt ¾ cup (170g) unsalted butter and let it cool for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> <strong> Mix Sugars and Butter: </strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, ¾ cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar, and ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar until smooth. </li>
        <li> <strong> Add Egg and Vanilla: </strong> Whisk in 1 large egg, 1 egg yolk, and 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract until combined. </li>
        <li> <strong> Combine Dry Ingredients: </strong> In a separate large bowl, whisk together 2¼ cups (280g) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1½ teaspoons cornstarch, and ½ teaspoon salt. </li>
        <li> <strong> Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures: </strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a large spoon or rubber spatula until a soft, thick, and slightly greasy dough forms. </li>
        <li> <strong> Fold in Chocolate Chips: </strong> Gently fold in 1¼ cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips. </li>
        <li> <strong> Chill Dough: </strong> Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for at least 2–3 hours, or up to 3–4 days. </li>
        <li> <strong> Preheat Oven: </strong> When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. </li>
        <li> <strong> Shape Cookies: </strong> Let the dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Scoop about 3 tablespoons of dough per cookie, roll into balls, and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart. </li>
        <li> <strong> Bake: </strong> Bake for 12–13 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. The centers will look soft. </li>
        <li> <strong> Cool: </strong> Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>        
    </ol>
    <p> After that's done, pour a glass and milk and enjoy your chewy chocolate chip cookies! </p>
